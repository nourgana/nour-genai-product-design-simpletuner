    Imagine an original visual description for the next Hublot limited edition watch created in collaboration with {ambassador} as part of a {theme} partnership.
    It is a unique timepiece with an exlusive design representing and embodying the essence and identity of the collaborating entity (ambassador/theme).
    Incorporate metaphors, subtle representations, or concepts that resonate with the collaboration. For example, if collaborating with a swimmer, integrate wave patterns on the bezel or case.
    Be creative and imaginative in your description, pushing the boundaries of traditional watch design.
    Ensure the description clearly conveys how the design represents the ambassador/theme. 
    
    Proceed in two steps:
    
    STEP 1. 
    Visual Description: What would the watch look like? 
    Include in the description the following elements in this order (comprehensive list):
    - Case 
    - Bezel 
    - Mouvement type : {movement}
    - Strap 
    - Dial 
    - Indexes 
    - Hands 
    - Text inscriptions 
    
    Keep the description the shortest possible, let it be keyword based, concise and straight to the point. NO bullet points.
    Here are some exemples of the expected ouput for the visual description:
    
    - Collaboration with ARTURO FUENTE:
    Shiny King Gold case set with white brilliant-cut diamonds and polished King Gold bezel set with white brilliant-cut diamonds. Automatic chronograph movement. Chocolate calfskin leather strap. Brown dial. Baton indexes. Red glaive hands. Inscription "Forbidden"
    
    - Collaboration with FIFA WORLD CUP:
    Front view of a Hublot watch. Case in polished satin-finished gold and bezel in polished satin-finished gold. Automatic movement. Black gummy alligator strap. King gold dial with the world cup embossed. Stick indexes. Sword-shaped hands.
    
    - Collaboration with Takashi Murakami:

    Constraints:
    NO portraits allowed. 
    Refrain from describing elements in non-seen areas of the watch like the case back.
    
    
    2. STEP 2
